      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first ever blog post. Probably not worth reading, or even writing for that matter - but we all have to start somewhere. I&amp;rsquo;m not even entirely sure what my intent is with this website. I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that it will eventually evolve into a sort of learning journal. A place to hone my understanding of topics that interest me by attempting to distill and teach them to others, as well as a place that I can look back at for instructions, should I forget some of those lessons that I fought so hard to learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
